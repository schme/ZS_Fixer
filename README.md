# ZS_Fixer
Simple script for fixing a bug that occurs when editing a Z-S Overview in the game Eve Online.
Fixes the faulty html tags that don't get handled properly after saving an overview setting in-game.

## Installs
You need Python 3.x

The .bat and .py files need to be in the same folder, otherwise location doesn't matter.

If you have both Python 2 and 3 installed, you might have to change the
```python``` command to ```python3``` and/or change the PATH variable.

To get rid of the any key confirmation at the end of the .bat file, you can comment out the ```pause```.
